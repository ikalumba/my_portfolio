      <p>
        Hi, I'm Isaac Kalumba, a passionate Full-Stack Developer dedicated to
        building impactful software solutions. My journey into software
        development was fueled by a deep desire solve real-world problems and
        after some research I decided to pivot from my career in the
        construction industry and learn the technical skills that would enable
        me bring real effective solutions to life. Whether it's designing simple
        tools to manage data and information using the google app suite,
        intuitive front-end interfaces with React or building robust back-end
        services with Node.js, I always find great purpose in building digital
        tools that improve lives and drive meaningful change. Beyond technical
        expertise, I bring strong communication, teamwork, and problem-solving
        skills, enabling me to collaborate effectively and adapt to dynamic
        challenges. I’m always eager to learn, staying up to date with emerging
        technologies to refine my craft. At my core, I believe in the power of
        technology to create opportunities, bridge gaps, and transform
        industries. Whether developing financial software, optimizing workflows,
        or expanding clean energy access, I’m committed to using my skills for
        innovation and social good. Let’s build something impactful together!
